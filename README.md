## How to play

Use the d-pad to switch between letters. The number keys can be used to jump to letters. For example, pressing the 6 key will cycle through "m", "n", and "o".

## Install

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Build the app

```
npm run build:kaios2 // For KaiOS 2.x
npm run build:kaios3 // For KaiOS 3.x
```

3. Load the `dist-v2` or `dist-v3` folder as a packaged app using your Web IDE of choice (I like Waterfox Classic)
